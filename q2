A.  Explain what recursion is and when it is useful.
    Explain what the |termination step| and |recursion step| are in a recursive method.
    
    Recursion is when you put the function itself into the function itself
    termination step is the first line of the loop that determine when the recursion stops.
    Recursion step is the last line of the method that use the method itself in the loop itself.

B.  Describe the difference between a Queue and a Stack.
Queue---First in first out
Stack---Last in first out

C.  Write a class for an element doublely-linked list.

public class DLnk{
  
  private Object payload;
  private DLnk next;
  private DLnk prev;
  
   public DLnk(DLnk next, DLnk prev, Object payload){
    this.next = next;
    this.prev=prev;
    this.payload = payload;}
    }

D.  Explain what a Merkle Tree is.  
    Merkle tree is a tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels or values of its child nodes. 
    
    Describe the structure and purpose of a Merkle Tree.
    they allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures.
    
    What is the Merkle root?
    Merkle root is the hash of all the hashes of all the transactions in the block.
    
    What is the function of a certificate in this data structure?
    It is way faster than other loops.
